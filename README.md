# Pictionary (needs rename)
Hello, welcome to the repository for the pictionary game! This project has been a good learning experience of event driven programming with Javascript and callbacks.
If you want to play the game, you will have to change the IP address and port forward your desired port. 

-Requires an installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run.
-All packages should be in node_modules.
